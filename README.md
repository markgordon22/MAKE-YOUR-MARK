## Design choices ##

When **designing** this website I looked for inspiration off several gym websites at first. I then came across [TNTGYM](https://tntgymsligo.ie/tnt-gym-sligo-opening-times/). On this page you can clearly 
see the membership rates along with what is attached to each rate.
I liked the way each membership rate broke down what it comes with. I used [bootstrapcards](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/card/) for both my classes page and membership page. I believed
a website with a consistent format made for easy viewing and readability.

### fonts ###

I decided to use the [epilogue](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Epilogue?query=epilogue) font due to personal liking and found it as nice attractive text for the user to read with. I incorporated this font from [googlefonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
Sans-serif was used as the back up font in case epilogue did nit work.

### Icons ###

Icons for this website were delivered by [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery). Icons were used as a styling purpose for elements such as the brand name in the navbar and for
the footer beside the email and phone contact details.

### Colors ###

Before deciding on what color scheme to adopt I did some research on the benefits of using certain color schemes. According to [shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/black-background-design-for-websites) "While pairing #000000 with crisp white can create a high-impact scheme". I used this for my containers and container text.
I used coolors to get portray my color scheme.

* Body element was given a light grey hex value: #a9a9a9;
* Containers were given a black hex value: #000000;
* Text, navbar and navlinks was given a white hex value: #000000;

For testing I used [W3 HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to check on errors in my html code for all pages and to correct them for submission.
I received errors from each of the four pages of the website. 

All 4 pages received these erros and fixes outlined below. 

   **errors**

   * gaps in the a href attribute of the phone number
   * p tags seen as children of the ul parent
   * stray div tags apparent
   * stray closing script ags apparent
   * no closing a tags for social media links.

   **fixes**

   * removed gaps from a href attribute of the phone number.
   * removed p tags as children of the ul parent.
   * removed stray div tags.
   * removed stray closing script tags
   * Inserted closing a tags for social media links.


I also used [W3 CSS validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to check on errors to eventually be corrected for final submission.
CSS is clean with no erros or warnings.

**errors**

* Card-img-top has to many values or values are not recognized : none. indicating the border radius class value.

**fixes**

* removed the border radius class.

## Bugs ##

Here are some of the **bugs** i encountered along the way of MAKE YOUR MARK

* Bug: Images in bootstrap cards and cards itself were extremely narrow on mobile and tablet devices
  Solution: Decreased the padding of the containers so that the cards could take up more room of the container so they could be easier
  to view and read.

* Bug: Navbar brand was not balanced on mobile and tablet devices.
  Solution: withrew the letter spacing.

* Bug: Image carousel images was switching to different sizes and thus making the container turn to different heights.
  Solution: gave each image carousel image a fixed height of 400px.

* Bug: social media links in footer were jumping to different lines on mobile.
  Solution: Gave a smaller padding so they wouldnt jump line.

* Bug: Bootstrap cards stuck to eachother as they were given a height of h-100
  Solution: removed h-100 class and gave a margin so that there will be some space between the cards.

* Bug: Contact form would not function correctly and wouldnt spot false email addresses without an @ or a false phone number.
  Solution: Inserted a class of class="form-control" in all inputs of the form and also gave a pattern class of pattern="[0-9]{3}[0-9]{3}[0-9]{4}" 
  to inform users the pattern of how to format the insertion of their phone number.
