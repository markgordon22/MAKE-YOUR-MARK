## Design choices ##

When **designing** this website I looked for inspiration off several gym websites at first. I then came across [TNTGYM](https://tntgymsligo.ie/tnt-gym-sligo-opening-times/). On this page you can clearly see the membership rates along with what is attached to each rate.
I liked the way each membership rate broke down what it comes with. I used [bootstrapcards](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/card/) for both my classes page and membership page. I believed
a website with a consistent format made for easy viewing and readability.

### fonts ###

I decided to use the [epilogue](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Epilogue?query=epilogue) font due to personal liking and found it as nice attractive text for the user to read with. I incorporated this font from [googlefonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

### Icons ###

Icons for this website were delivered by [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery). Icons were used as a styling purpose for elements such as the brand name in the navbar and for
the footer beside the email and phone contact details.

### Colors ###

Before deciding on what color scheme to adopt I did some research on the benefits of using certain color schemes. According to [shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/black-background-design-for-websites) "While pairing #000000 with crisp white can create a high-impact scheme". I used this for my containers and container text.
I used coolors to get portray my color scheme.

* Body element was given a light grey hex value: #a9a9a9;
* Containers were given a black hex value: #000000;
* Text, navbar and navlinks was given a white hex value: #000000;

## Wireframing ##

I began wireframing with a pen and paper to get a rough feel of what I wanted my site to look and feel. I downloaded [balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to complete my wireframes for **MAKEYOURMARK**
View my wireframes [here](https://github.com/markgordon22/MAKEYOURMARK/tree/main/wireframes).

The 4 pages below contain the wireframe devices of mobile, tablet and desktop.
